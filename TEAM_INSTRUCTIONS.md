# AlboradaIT Team Instructions

When you need to create a new project, reference the appropriate cookbook from:

**https://github.com/AlboradaIT/project-cookbooks**

## For Laravel Web Applications

Tell your AI agent:

```
"Create a new Laravel web application following the AlboradaIT cookbook at:
https://github.com/AlboradaIT/project-cookbooks/blob/main/laravel-web-app/cookbook.md"
```

The AI agent will follow the cookbook instructions to create a standardized project with Docker, Traefik, and all necessary configurations.
